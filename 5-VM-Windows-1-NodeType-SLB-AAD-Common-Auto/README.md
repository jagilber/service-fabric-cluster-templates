# 5 Node 1 node type secure Windows Service Fabric Cluster with standard load balancer, AAD, Automatic OS Upgrade, and common name certificate

This template allows you to deploy a secure 5 node, 1 Node Type Service Fabric Cluster with Standard load balancer running Windows Server 2022 Datacenter on a Standard_DS4_v2 Size Virtual Machine Scale set. Additionally, this template is configured to use certificate common name (subject name) instead of thumbprint which is a Service Fabric best practice. This template is also configured for Azure Active Directory authentication. [Set up Azure Active Directory for client authentication in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-cluster-creation-setup-azure-ad-via-portal) provides the steps necessary for creation of the client and cluster App registration accounts. After accounts have been created, this template can be used to deploy the cluster with AAD configuration enabled.

```json
"azureActiveDirectory": {
    "clientApplication": "[parameters('aadClientApplication')]",
    "clusterApplication": "[parameters('aadClusterApplication')]",
    "tenantId": "[parameters('aadTenantId')]"
},
```

    - Iaas Diagnostic
    - Key Vault Virtual Machine (KVVM) extension
- 1 User Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) for KVVM extension

- 1 network security group
- 1 virtual network
- 2 storage account v2
  - diagnostics
  - service fabric logs

## Certificates

This template assumes that you already have certificates uploaded to your key vault. Production clusters should always use a CA signed certificate. If needing a certificate for testing, a .pfx certificate can be generated directly in the key vault or if you want to create a new certificate run the [New-ServiceFabricClusterCertificate.ps1](../scripts/New-ServiceFabricClusterCertificate.ps1) file in this repository. That script will output the values necessary for deployment via the parameters file.

> [!NOTE]  
> Azure Key vault 'Access Configuration' should have 'Azure Virtual Machines for deployment' and 'Azure Resource Manager for template deployment' enabled for node key vault access during template deployment.

You can download the .PFX from the key vault from the portal

- Go to the key vault resource
- navigate to the secrets tab and download the .pfx

## Identities

This template is configured to use a User Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) for the Key Vault Virtual Machine (KVVM) extension. The UAMI is created as part of the deployment and assigned to the KVVM extension. The UAMI is also assigned the Key Vault Secrets User role on the key vault.
The UAMI is created in the same resource group as the cluster and can be used for other resources in the same resource group.

Both Identities and Role Assignment Ids are deployment unique. Initial deployment will create a new UAMI and Role Assignment Id. The UAMI and Role Assignment Ids are not required to be passed in as parameters and will be auto generated if not. If the template is re-deployed, the UAMI and Role Assignment Id will be updated unless the original ones from initial deployment are provided. See [Known Issues](#known-issues) for more information.

### Identities in this template

- userAssignedIdentityName: The name of the UAMI to be created. This is a deployment unique name and will be auto generated if not provided.
- userIdentitySecretUserId: The role assignment id for the UAMI. This is the role assignment id is used to provide `Secrets User` access to the key vault. This is a deployment unique guid and will be auto generated if not provided.
- userIdentityKeyVaultReaderId: The role assignment id for the UAMI. This is the role assignment id is used to provide `Key Vault Reader` access to the key vault. This is a deployment unique guid and will be auto generated if not provided.

> [!NOTE]  
> If patching the cluster, the existing UAMI and Role Assignment Ids should be passed in as parameters to avoid creating new ones.

## Use Powershell to deploy your cluster

Execute from a machine with Azure 'Az.Accounts' and 'Az.Resources' modules installed. Optionally, uncomment the `Install-Module` lines to install the modules if not already installed.

```powershell
# Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
# Install-Module -Name Az.Resources -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
Import-Module Az.Accounts
Import-Module Az.Resources
Connect-AzAccount

$location = '<location>'
$resourceGroupName = '<resource group name>'
$templateFile = '.\azuredeploy.json'
$templateParameterFile = '.\azuredeploy.parameters.json'

New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName `
            -DeploymentDebugLogLevel All `
            -TemplateFile $templateFile `
            -TemplateParameterFile $templateParameterFile `
            -Verbose
```

## Use Powershell to connect to your cluster

Execute from a windows powershell command prompt with the Service Fabric SDK installed. The Service Fabric SDK can be installed from the [Download and install the runtime and SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started) page.

```powershell
Import-Module ServiceFabric

$location = '<location>'
$clusterName = '<cluster name>'
$serverCommonName = '<cluster certificate subject name>'

$clusterFqdn = "$clusterName.$location.cloudapp.azure.com"
$clusterEndpoint = "$($clusterFqdn):19000"
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster -ConnectionEndpoint $clusterEndpoint `
    -ServerCommonName $serverCommonName `
    -AzureActiveDirectory `
    -Verbose
```

## Known Issues

- RoleAssignmentUpdateNotPermitted: This can occur if existing role assignments are being updated. This is a known issue with the Azure Resource Manager API. The workaround is to delete the existing role assignment and re-create it. The following error message will be shown in the deployment output:

  ```text
  New-azResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName <resource group name>
      | 12:00:00 PM - The deployment failed with error(s). Showing 3 out of 3 error(s). Status Message: Tenant ID,
      | application ID, principal ID, and scope are not allowed to be updated. (Code:RoleAssignmentUpdateNotPermitted)  Status Message:     
      | Tenant ID, application ID, principal ID, and scope are not allowed to be updated. (Code:RoleAssignmentUpdateNotPermitted)  Status   
      | Message: At least one resource deployment operation failed. Please list deployment operations for details. Please see
      | https://aka.ms/arm-deployment-operations for usage details. (Code: DeploymentFailed)  - Tenant ID, application ID, principal ID,    
      | and scope are not allowed to be updated. (Code:RoleAssignmentUpdateNotPermitted)  - Tenant ID, application ID, principal ID, and
